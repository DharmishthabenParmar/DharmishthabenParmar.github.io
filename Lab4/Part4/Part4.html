  Description:This JavaScript code creates an interactive canvas animation with bouncing colorful balls and 
  a controllable white circle. The `Ball` class defines properties like position, 
  velocity, color, and size for each ball, with methods for drawing, updating, and
   detecting collisions. The `EvilCircle` class represents the controllable white circle,
    reacting to arrow key inputs and eliminating balls upon collision. The animation continuously 
    updates, rendering the canvas and providing an engaging interactive experience. The ball count 
    is displayed, decreasing as balls are eliminated. Overall, the code combines object-oriented
   principles with event handling to create a dynamic and visually appealing animation.-->
