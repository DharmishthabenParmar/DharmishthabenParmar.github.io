  Description:This JavaScript code initializes and configures an HTML canvas for animation, 
  spawning 25 bouncing balls with random colors and velocities. 
  The balls dynamically traverse the canvas, changing colors upon collision detection.
   The animation loop continuously updates the canvas, creating an interactive and visually appealing display. 
   This simple yet dynamic implementation offers an engaging user experience by combining random motion and 
   color-changing interactions within the animated environment.-->
